### Hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I´m Juan Pablo, from Buenos Aires - Argentina


I´m [Juan Pablo Larraza](https://jplarraza-cv.netlify.app/) a UX/Product Designer with over 5 years of experience across industries such as banking, e-commerce, crypto, and healthcare. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to lead end-to-end design processes—from research to handoff to development—always balancing business needs with users’ problems and expectations.

I’ve worked closely with design and technology teams, as well as with roles such as Project Managers, Product Owners, CTOs, and CPOs, which gave me a holistic view of how design can drive real impact within a product.

I’m excited about the opportunity to join your company and contribute my experience to creating digital experiences that are simple, clear, and user-centered.
